# Developer Platform

You can think stackoverflow but there are some differences than that. There are chat rooms for discussing issues and code sharing, so this makes it easy to getting answers. This product aims to better development environment and communication.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
